LEFT JOIN tasks T ON P.id = T.project_id
GROUP BY P.name
ORDER BY COUNT(T.project_id) DESC

3. get the count of all tasks in each project, order by projects names
SELECT P.name, COUNT(T.project_id)
FROM projects P
LEFT JOIN tasks T ON P.id = T.project_id
GROUP BY P.name
ORDER BY P.name

4. get the tasks for all projects having the name beginning with “N” letter
SELECT T.name
FROM tasks T, projects P
WHERE P.name LIKE 'N%' AND P.id =T.id

SELECT P.name, COUNT(T.project_id)
FROM projects P
LEFT JOIN tasks T ON P.id = T.project_id
WHERE P.name LIKE '%a%'
GROUP BY P.name

6. get the list of tasks with duplicate names. Order alphabetically
SELECT name

FROM tasks T
INNER JOIN projects P ON P.id=T.project_id

HAVING COUNT(T.project_id)>1
ORDER BY COUNT(T.project_id)

8. get the list of project names having more than 10 tasks in status ‘completed’. Order by project_id
